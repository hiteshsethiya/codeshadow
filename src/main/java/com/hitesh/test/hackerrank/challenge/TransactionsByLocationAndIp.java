    /*
     * 1. Transactions by Location and IP
     *
     * In this challenge,
     * use the HTTP GET method to retrieve information from a database of Card Transactionsrecords for users.
     * Query https: //jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/transactions/search?userId=uid
     * where uid is the value of user id passed to the function, to find all the records that belong to the user with id uid.
     * The query response is paginated and can be further accessed by appending to
     * the query string page=num where num is the page number.
     * The query response from the APIis a JSON response with the following five fields:
     * page: the current page
     * per_page: the maximum number of results per page
     * total: the total number of records in the search result
     * total_pages: the total number of pages which must be queried to get all the results
     * data: an array of JSON objects that contains transaction records.
     * The data field in the response contains a list of the transaction records,
     * with each transaction record following the below-described schema:
     *
     * id: the unique ID of the record
     * timestamp: the timestamp when the record was generated (InUTCmilliseconds)
     * userId: theuser id of the user who performed the transaction
     * userName: the user name of the user who performed the transaction
     * txnType: the transaction type of the transaction. Allowed values are debit and credit.
     * amount: the transaction amount. Stored as a string with the currency structure and prefixed with the $ sign, e.g. "$2,273.95".
     * location: object , the location description of the transaction location.
     *     id: The id of the location where the transaction took place location.
     *     address: The address of the location where the transaction took place location.
     *     city: The citywhere the transaction took place location.
     *     zipCode: The zip code of the location where the transaction took place
     *     ip: the IP address of the device which was used to perform the transaction
     *
     * Given the user-id uid, the provided location id locationId, the ip address range netStart to netEnd,
     * find and return the sum of the amount in the records that have the network prefix in the inclusive range
     * netStart to netEnd, belongs to the user uid and has been performed in the location with the id locationId.
     *
     * Note that the search is not case sensitive.
     *
     * NOTE :netStart and netEnd refer to the first byte of the IPV4 address.
     * So for example, to find the IP addresses in the range netStart and netEnd, take the first part of the IP address
     * 172.187.11.212 which is 172 and match if it belongs between the range netStart and netEnd.
     *
     * getTransactions has the following parameter(s):
     * int uid: the id by which record will be fetched
     * int locationId: the location id where the transaction took place
     * int netStart: the starting value (inclusive) of the network address for the device from which the transaction took place
     * int netEnd: the end value (inclusive) of the network address for the device from which the transaction took place
     *
     *     Returns:
     *     int:the sum of amount for all transaction which matches the filter criteria rounded to the nearest integer
     *
     * Input Format For Custom Testing
     * The first line contains an integer, uid.
     * The second line contains an integer, locationId.
     * The third line contains an integer, netStart.
     * The last line contains an integer, netEnd.
     *
     * Sample Case 0
     * Sample Input For Custom Testing
     * STDIN Function
     * -------------
     * 2竊置id = 2
     * 8竊値ocationId = 8
     * 5竊地etStart = 5
     * 50竊地etEnd = 50
     *
     * Sample Output 8446
     * Given
     * uid = 2 the query is
     * https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/transactions/search?userId=2&page=1
     * and the response is:
     * [
     *    {
     *       "id":70,
     *       "userId":2,
     *       "userName":"Bob Martin",
     *       "timestamp":1550214607032,
     *       "txnType":"credit",
     *       "amount":"$2,411.06",
     *       "location":{
     *          "id":8,
     *          "address":"389, Everest, Barwell Terrace",
     *          "city":"Murillo",
     *          "zipCode":66061
     *       },
     *       "ip":"13.211.252.55"
     *    }
     * ]
     *
     * Apply the filter for netStartand netEnd, netStart is 5 and value of input netEnd is 50.
     * The first record has an IP address 13.211.252.55.
     * After formatting the IP address, the first byte is 13 which is between the range of netStart and netEnd.
     * Thus this record passes the filter criteria.
     * After applying this filter criteria for all the records with user ID 2 and location ID 8, there are 5 records.
     * The sum of the amounts in these 5 records is 8446, the final output.
